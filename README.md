# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
Java based classic-style Pokemon battle simulator.
- Project originally taken on as a lab exercise for CSC 330 - Object Oriented Programming, but I plan to expand upon it as a side-project.

## How to Run
- Currently, this project can be run through an IDE such as Eclipse, or by creating an executable .Jar file from the IDE, and running it through the command prompt.

## Current State
- The user is assigned a Pokemon and an Item; Treecko and a Power Potion.
- The computer player is also assigned a Pokemon and an Item; Mudkip and a Health Potion.
- The two pokemon are assigned the same stats.
- The user controls the battle through a number-key based menu system, allowing them to select from a list of attacks, use their item, or run away.
- Computer AI is based on randomly generated actions. (It's a little dumb.)
- For what it is so far, the program runs very well.

## Possible future improvements
- More options of Pokemon.
- The ability to create a team of Pokemon.
- The use of multiple items.
- Improved computer AI
- GUI's, hopefully replicating something similar to classic Pokemon-style menus!
